#### Add to the DOM with a loop

First goal: Add 10 divs to the DOM
- Write a for loop that counts from 1 to 10
- Create a square (Hint: use createElement) and add a .square class to give it shape
- Combine the two and generate many squares
- Append to the DOM each time the loop runs

#### Add to the DOM using a function that runs a loop

- Wrap the previous process in a function
- Run it multiple times for fun

#### Give the function an argument

- Provide the function with a parameter and argument, and run the loop that many times.

#### Color the squares

- Let's give ourselve more control over the color selection by using rgb values for our colors

```
.square {
    background-color: rgb(25, 241, 84);
}
```
`rgb` stands for **red**, **green**, and **blue**. Each number is between 0 and 255, and determines how much red, how much green, and how much blue to blend.

#### Color each square with a random color


#### Add text to each square
